        {{ link }} to authenticate with reddit and download your file.<br><br>

        <b>what</b><br>
        savvit backs up the pages you have saved on reddit. it exports them
        to a bookmarks file that you can import in to your web browser
        or view as a regular html file.<br><br>

        <b>how</b><br>
        savvit is a tiny python script that uses praw, flask, twisted, and a
        few other packages. you can find the source
        <a href="http://github.com/1npo/savvit">here</a>.<br><br>

        <b>limitations</b><br>
        chrome has a bug that prevents it from loading the bookmarks file,
        but a bug report has been filed and it's being fixed. only
        firefox has been tested to work for importing bookmarks, but you
        can use any browser to view the file as regular html.<br><br>

        <b>feedback</b><br>
        i plan on developing savvit a bit further if enough people like it.
        if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please feel free to
        comment on github or send a message to /u/1npo on reddit.

        <b>quick start</b><br>
        {{ link }} to authenticate with reddit and download your file.<br><br>

        <b>what</b><br>
        savvit backs up the pages you have saved on reddit. it exports them
        to a bookmarks file that you can import in to your web browser
        or view as a regular html file.<br><br>

        <b>how</b><br>
        savvit is a tiny python script that uses praw, flask, and a
        few other packages. you can find the source
        <a href="http://github.com/1npo/savvit">here</a>.<br><br>

        <b>limitations</b><br>
        chrome has a bug that prevents it from loading the bookmarks file,
        but a bug report has been filed and it's being fixed. only
        firefox has been tested to work for importing bookmarks, but you
        can use any browser to open the file like a regular html file.<br><br>

        <b>feedback</b><br>
        i plan on developing savvit a bit further. if you have any
        questions, comments, or suggestions, please feel free to comment
        on github or send a message to /u/1npo on reddit.
